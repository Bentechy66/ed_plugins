# Enhanced Discord Plugins
EnhancedDiscord plugins that I have made.

## To use:
Go to the folder containing the plugin you wish to download, and grab the `.js` file in the directory and place it in your `EnhancedDiscord/plugins` directory. This is located wherever you first launched the exe to install EnhancedDiscord. The README showing will provide instructions and information on how to use the plugin.
